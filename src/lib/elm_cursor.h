/**
 * @defgroup Elm_Cursors Cursors
 * @ingroup Elementary
 *
 * The Elementary cursor is an internal smart object used to
 * customize the mouse cursor displayed over objects (or
 * widgets). In the most common scenario, the cursor decoration
 * comes from the graphical @b engine Elementary is running
 * on. Those engines may provide different decorations for cursors,
 * and Elementary provides functions to choose them (think of X11
 * cursors, as an example).
 *
 * By default, Elementary searches cursors only from engine.
 * There's also the possibility of, besides using engine provided
 * cursors, also use the ones coming from Edje theme files. Both
 * globally and per widget, Elementary makes it possible for one to
 * make the cursors lookup to be held on engines only or on
 * Elementary's theme file, too. To set cursor's hot spot,
 * two data items should be added to cursor's theme: "hot_x" and
 * "hot_y", that are the offset from upper-left corner of the cursor
 * (coordinates 0,0).
