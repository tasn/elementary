 *
 * This class defines a common interface for objects acting like
 * containers, i.e. objects parenting others and displaying their
 * childs "inside" of them somehow.
 *
 * The container must define "parts" (or spots) into which child
 * objects will be placed, inside of it. This is a way of handling
 * more the one content object, by naming content locations
 * properly. This is the role of the @c name argument of the virtual
 * functions in the class.
 *
 * The following object functions are meant to be used with all
 * container objects and derived ones:
 *
 * - elm_object_part_content_set()
 * - elm_object_part_content_get()
 * - elm_object_part_content_unset()
