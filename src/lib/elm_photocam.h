 *
 * Photocam is a widget meant specifically for displaying
 * high-resolution digital camera photos, giving speedy feedback (fast
 * load), zooming and panning as well as fitting logic, all with low
 * memory footprint. It is entirely focused on @b jpeg images, and
 * takes advantage of properties of the jpeg format (via Evas loader
 * features in the jpeg loader).
 *
 * Signals that you can add callbacks for are:
 * @li @c "clicked" - This is called when a user has clicked the photo
 *        without dragging around.
 * @li @c "press" - This is called when a user has pressed down on the
 *        photo.
 * @li @c "longpressed" - This is called when a user has pressed down
 *        on the photo for a long time without dragging around.
 * @li @c "clicked,double" - This is called when a user has
 *        double-clicked the photo.
 * @li @c "load" - Photo load begins.
 * @li @c "loaded" - This is called when the image file load is
 *        complete for the first view (low resolution blurry version).
 * @li @c "load,detail" - Photo detailed data load begins.
 * @li @c "loaded,detail" - This is called when the image file load is
 *        complete for the detailed image data (full resolution
 *        needed).
 * @li @c "zoom,start" - Zoom animation started.
 * @li @c "zoom,stop" - Zoom animation stopped.
 * @li @c "zoom,change" - Zoom changed when using an auto zoom mode.
 * @li @c "scroll" - the content has been scrolled (moved)
 * @li @c "scroll,anim,start" - scrolling animation has started
 * @li @c "scroll,anim,stop" - scrolling animation has stopped
 * @li @c "scroll,drag,start" - dragging the contents around has started
 * @li @c "scroll,drag,stop" - dragging the contents around has stopped
 * @li @c "focused" - When the photocam has received focus. (since 1.8)
 * @li @c "unfocused" - When the photocam has lost focus. (since 1.8)
 *
 * This widget implements the @b @ref elm-scrollable-interface
 * interface, so that all (non-deprecated) functions for the base @ref
 * Scroller widget also work for photocam objects.
 *
 * Some calls on the photocam's API are marked as @b deprecated, as
 * they just wrap the scrollable widgets counterpart functions. Use
 * the ones we point you to, for each case of deprecation here,
 * instead -- eventually the deprecated ones will be discarded (next
 * major release).
 *
 * @ref tutorial_photocam shows the API in action.
