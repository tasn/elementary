 * A ColorSelector is a color selection widget. It allows application
 * to set a series of colors.It also allows to load/save colors
 * from/to config with a unique identifier, by default, the colors are
 * loaded/saved from/to config using "default" identifier. The colors
 * can be picked by user from the color set by clicking on individual
 * color item on the palette or by selecting it from selector.
 *
 * This widget inherits from the @ref Layout one, so that all the
 * functions acting on it also work for check objects.
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref Layout:
 * - @c "changed" - When the color value changes on selector
 *   event_info is NULL.
 * - @c "color,item,selected" - When user clicks on color item. The
 *   event_info parameter of the callback will be the selected color
 *   item.
 * - @c "color,item,longpressed" - When user long presses on color
 *   item. The event info parameter of the callback contains selected
 *   color item.
 * - @c "focused" - When the colorselector has received focus. (since 1.8)
 * - @c "unfocused" - When the colorselector has lost focus. (since 1.8)
 * - @c "language,changed" - the program's language changed (since 1.9)
