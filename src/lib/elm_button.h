 *
 * This is a push-button. Press it and run some function. It can contain
 * a simple label and icon object and it also has an autorepeat feature.
 *
 * This widget inherits from the @ref Layout one, so that all the
 * functions acting on it also work for button objects.
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref Layout:
 * @li "clicked": the user clicked the button (press/release).
 * @li "repeated": the user pressed the button without releasing it.
 * @li "pressed": button was pressed.
 * @li "unpressed": button was released after being pressed.
 * @li @c "focused" : When the button has received focus. (since 1.8)
 * @li @c "unfocused" : When the button has lost focus. (since 1.8)
 * In all cases, the @c event parameter of the callback will be
 * @c NULL.
 *
 * Also, defined in the default theme, the button has the following styles
 * available:
 * @li default: a normal button.
 * @li anchor: Like default, but the button fades away when the mouse is not
 * over it, leaving only the text or icon.
 * @li hoversel_vertical: Internally used by @ref Hoversel to give a
 * continuous look across its options.
 * @li hoversel_vertical_entry: Another internal for @ref Hoversel.
 * @li naviframe: Internally used by @ref Naviframe for its back button.
 * @li colorselector: Internally used by @ref Colorselector
 * for its left and right buttons.
 *
 * Default content parts of the button widget that you can use for are:
 * @li "icon" - An icon of the button
 *
 * Default text parts of the button widget that you can use for are:
 * @li "default" - A label of the button
