 *
 * This is a widget specifically for displaying a map. It uses basically
 * OpenStreetMap provider http://www.openstreetmap.org/,
 * but custom providers can be added.
 *
 * It supports some basic but yet nice features:
 * @li zooming and scrolling,
 * @li markers with content to be displayed when user clicks over them,
 * @li group of markers and
 * @li routes.
 *
 * This widget implements the @b @ref elm-scrollable-interface
 * interface, so that all (non-deprecated) functions for the base @ref
 * Scroller widget also work for map objects.
 *

 *                         the map.
 * - @c "press" - This is called when a user has pressed down on the map.

 *   @c for a long time without dragging around.
