           This function will make sure that the inwin $obj is completely visible
           by calling evas_object_show() and evas_object_raise() on it, to bring it
           to the front. It also sets the keyboard focus to it, which will be passed
           onto its content.

           The object's theme will also receive the signal "elm,action,show" with
           source "elm".]]
