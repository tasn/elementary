         [[Set user data for a given prefs widget

           Once a prefs widget is created, after elm_prefs_file_set() is
           issued on it, all of its UI elements will get default values, when
           declared on that file. To fetch an user's own, personal set of
           those values, one gets to pair a prefs data handle to the
           prefs widget. This is what this call is intended for.

           Prefs data values from $prefs_data with keys matching the ones
           present on the file passed on elm_prefs_file_set() to $obj will
           have their values applied to the respective UI elements of the
           widget.

           When $obj dies, the values of the elements declared on its
           .epb file (the one set on elm_prefs_file_set()) marked as permanent
           will be written back to prefs_data, if it is writable.
           One is also able to make this writing event to take place
           automatically after each UI element modification by using
           elm_prefs_autosave_set().

           Note: $obj will keep a reference of its own for $prefs_data,
           but you should still unreference it by yourself, after the widget
           is gone.
