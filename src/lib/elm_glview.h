 *
 * A GLView widget allows for simple GL rendering in elementary environment.
 * GLView hides all the complicated evas_gl details so that the user only
 * has to deal with registering a few callback functions for rendering
 * to a surface using OpenGL APIs.
 *
 * This widget emits the following signals, besides the ones sent from
 * @ref GLView:
 * - @c "focused" - when glview has received focus.
 * - @c "unfocused" - when glview has lost focus.
 * - @c "language,changed" - the program's language changed
 *
 * Below is an illustrative example of how to use GLView and and OpenGL
 * to render in elementary environment.
